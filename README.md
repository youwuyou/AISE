# AI in Sciences and Engineering - Final Projects

This repository contains the implementation of the final projects for the course AI in Sciences and Engineering 401-4656-21L at ETH Z√ºrich.


## Repository Structure

The repository consists of three main projects, we try to resolve all projects using both AI-based and traditional numerical approaches:

1. Training FNO to Solve the 1D Wave Equation
2. PDE-Find: Reconstructing PDEs from Data
3. Foundation Models for Phase-Field Dynamics

## Progress Overview

| Task  | ML-based Implementation | Numerical Solver Implementation | Documentation |

## Reports and Documentation

- Original project handouts locates under the `assets/` directory
- Each project `X ‚àà {1, 2, 3}` contains:
    - an associated report `report.pdf` located under `project_X/` folder
    - For each task, we reported our results using maximal two pages
    - Visualizations and results can be found in the `results/` directory


For project reports, experiments were conducted using the hardware & software configuration as follows:


| **CPU Model** | **CPU Core Info** | **Memory** |
|-------------|------------------|------------|
| Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-12700H | 20 Cores @ 4.70 GHz | 15 GB RAM + 32 GB Swap |
| **Python** | **Deep Learning Framework** | **OS** |
| Python 3.10.12 | PyTorch 2.5.1 | Garuda Linux x86_64 |
