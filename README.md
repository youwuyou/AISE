# AI in Sciences and Engineering - Final Projects

This repository contains the implementation of the final projects for the AI in Sciences and Engineering course at ETH Z√ºrich.


## Repository Structure

The repository consists of three main projects, we try to resolve all projects using both AI-based and traditional numerical approaches:

1. Training FNO to Solve the 1D Wave Equation
2. PDE-Find: Reconstructing PDEs from Data
3. Foundation Models for Phase-Field Dynamics
