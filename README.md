# AI in Sciences and Engineering - Final Projects

This repository contains the implementation of the final projects for the course AI in Sciences and Engineering 401-4656-21L at ETH Z√ºrich.

## Installation

1. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

2. Install Git LFS (for fetching trained models under `project_X/checkpoints`):

```bash
pip install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Repository Structure

The repository consists of three main projects, we try to resolve all projects using both AI-based and traditional numerical approaches:

1. Training FNO to Solve the 1D Wave Equation
2. PDE-Find: Reconstructing PDEs from Data
3. Foundation Models for Phase-Field Dynamics

## Progress Overview

## Experimental Setup

- Original project handouts locates under the `assets/` directory
- Each project `X ‚àà {1, 2, 3}` contains:
    - an associated report `report.pdf` located under `project_X/` folder
    - For each task, we reported our results using maximal two pages
    - Visualizations and results can be found in the `results/` directory


For project reports, experiments were conducted on the `piora` cluster from the student cluster competition team RACKlette @ ETHZ using the hardware & software configuration as follows:
